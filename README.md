# bamazon app
This is a node app that uses the Command Line to navigate a database with products for an online store.

No working link because there is no actual HTML or interactive DOM.

## Objectives

 - Use MySQL to create a database containing information about the products for sale.
 - Use Node to allow a customer to place an order.
 - Use Node to allow a manager to add products or check inventory.
 - Use Node to allow a supervisor to check department sales data.

The customer must then enter the id of the item they want and how much of that item they want. The app then determines if there is enough stock to fill the order. If not, it alerts the customer. If it does, it places the order, changing the database to reflect this, and displays the customer's total price. The second is for the manager. It starts by displaying a menu of options. The manager can choose to display all of the products currently available. They can choose to display all
