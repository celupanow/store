# bamazon app
This is a node app that uses the Command Line to navigate a database with products for an online store.

No working link because there is no actual HTML or interactive DOM.

## Objectives

 - Use MySQL to create a database containing information about the products for sale.
 - Use Node to allow a customer to place an order.
 - Use Node to allow a manager to add products 
 - Use a separate js file for the keys needed to call the Spotify API.
 - Use a txt file for a command that reads the txt file and follows whatever command and search term is in the txt file.
 
## How It Works
The user must put two items into the command line. The first one is a command. The user can put in "concert-this", which will search the Bands In Town API for venue name, venue location, and time for the next concert of whatever musical artist is searched. They can put in "spotify-this-song", which will search the Spotify API for the artist, song name, spotify link, and the album name. They can use "movie-this", which will search the OMDB API for the title, year, ratings, country, language, plot, and actors. The last command is "do-what-it-says", which reads the random.txt file and follows the command and search term to run one of the above commands.
